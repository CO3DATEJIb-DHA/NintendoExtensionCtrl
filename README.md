# Nintendo Extension Controller Library

This is an Arduino library that makes it easy to read data from Nintendo extension controllers such as the Wii Nunchuk and Classic Controller.

"Extension controller" is the name given to devices that *extend* the functionality of the [Wiimote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote), plugging into the expansion port at the bottom of the device. While originally designed for Wiimote accessories, the port and communication protocol is now also being used for the controllers of Nintendo's new line of "Mini" consoles.
